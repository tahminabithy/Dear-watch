        description: 'Well-designed and well-priced, there’s a reason why Longines has become one of the biggest watch brands in the world. Its Spirit collection was launched in 2020 to celebrate Longines affinity with aviation – defined by a crisp, clean aesthetic for easy readability. Its newest version comes in titanium and costs a fraction over £2.5k. A steal for a chronometer-certified watch.',

        description: 'The Top Time Classic Cars collection of chronographs pays tribute to three all-American mid-century motoring icons. It comprises watches inspired by Chevrolet’s “Stingray” Corvette, Ford’s Mustang and the AC Shelby Cobra. They’re all great, but forced to pick one we will choose the latter – a tribute to the car Carrol Shelby imagined that combined British chassis design with go-get-‘em American racing engineering.',

Albeit, a very high-end one. Endorsed by mountain-ascending adventure photographer Cory Richards, The Overseas Limited Editions “Everest” has a titanium and steel case, a suitably outdoorsy blue-grey dial and comes in two versions, a dual time and a chronograph, both with bright orange details on the hands, strap and other indicators.',
